# FinalYearProject

This repository contains the source code for my final year project. To run the code, you need to clone the full repository.

You first need to install the appropriate libraries. For `pip`, you can use the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For conda, you can use the following commands:
```
conda install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas tabulate
pip install import-ipynb transformers datasets
```

You then need to extract the `triviaqa.json` file.
