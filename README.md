# Final Year Project 

This repository contains the source code for my final year project. To run the code, you need to clone the full repository.

# Installing libraries 

You need to install the appropriate libraries. For `pip`, you can use the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For `conda`, you can use the following commands:
```
conda install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas tabulate
pip install import-ipynb transformers datasets
```

# Running the application
To run the main program, run the `main.ipynb` notebook. The `testing.ipynb` notebook holds the code related to testing, and the `functions.ipynb` holds the supplementary functions for extracting text and obtaining the final answer.

# Testing
For testing, you need to extract the `triviaqa.json` file. Note that for the code, the TriviaQA dataset must be manually downloaded. Then, run the `testing.ipynb` notebook.
